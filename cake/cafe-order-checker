cafe-order-checker

Given all three arrays, write a method to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

iterate across served orders, track index of takeout and dine in, if it doesn't match one of them return false

a = to[0]
b = di[0]
for i in SO:
	if a || b != []
	if i in a:
		a.pop(0)
	elif i in b:
		b.pop(0)
	else return false
