rectangular-love

Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
love_rec = {

    # Coordinates of bottom-left corner
    'left_x'   : 1,
    'bottom_y' : 1,

    # Width and height
    'width'    : 6,
    'height'   : 3,
}

looking for x1-x2>0 and y1-y2>0, => width and height unless it's greater than x.right or y.top
where x1,y1 is top right of one, x2,y2 is bottom left of the other
bot left coordinates are x2,y2
