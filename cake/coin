coin

Write a function that, given:

an amount of money
a list of coin denominations
computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=44 (44¢) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢

knapsack

ways_of_doing_n_cents = [0] * (amount + 1)
ways_of_doing_n_cents[0] = 1

for x in coins:

    for y in range(x, amount + 1):
        higher_amount_remainder = y - x
        ways_of_doing_n_cents[y] += (
            ways_of_doing_n_cents[higher_amount_remainder]
        )
