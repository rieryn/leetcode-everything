find-duplicate-files
walk through file tree, hash binaries you haven't seen and compare binaries, make new tuples
check created date for origiinal file

checking ctime is system dependent, you could use getmtime
getmtime> last path modification
getctime>creation date OR last inode modification on unix 

there's no way to get creation time on <ext4

instead of hashing the whole contents of each file, we hashed three fixed-size "samples" from each file made of the first xx bytes, the middle xx bytes, and the last xx bytes
block size depends on filesystem

might return different files if you don't check the whole binary
