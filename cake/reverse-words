reverse-words
Write a function reverse_words() that takes a message as a list of characters and reverses the order of the words in place. â†´

reverse whole list then reverse words

def f(list):
	l_ind = 0
	r_ind = len(list-1)
	while (l_ind<r_ind):
		list[l_ind], list[r_ind] = list[r_ind], list[l_ind]
		l_ind +=1
		r_ind -=1
	return list

def reverse_words(message):
# First we reverse all the characters in the entire message
reverse_characters(message, 0, len(message)-1)

# This gives us the right word order
# but with each word backward

# Now we'll make the words forward again
# by reversing each word's characters

# We hold the index of the *start* of the current word
# as we look for the *end* of the current word
current_word_start_index = 0

for i in range(len(message) + 1):
    # Found the end of the current word!
    if (i == len(message)) or (message[i] == ' '):
        reverse_characters(message, current_word_start_index, i - 1)
        # If we haven't exhausted the message our
        # next word's start is one character ahead
        current_word_start_index = i + 1
